# README Generator CLI Application

## Description
Using the command line with node.js and the inquirer package, a user is given a series of specific questions to answer regarding their new project. Once the user has completed answering all the questions, a professional README file is generated with the following sections: Title, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

The installation question will default to `npm i`, however the user is able to change this if needed.

There will be a list of different license badges (MIT, APACHE 2.0, GPL 3.0, BSD 3, None) the user can select from. When a license is selected, the badge will display below the title and the license information will display within the license section.

The testing question will default to `npm test`, however the user is able to change this if needed.

The user's github username and email address are added as contact information to the questions section.
